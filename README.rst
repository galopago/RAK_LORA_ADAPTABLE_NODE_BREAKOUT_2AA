Key features:
-------------
* Double sided traces and pads for added strength
* Prototype area with two parallel tracks connecting multiple pads, to be used as a power&ground rails
* Solder directly to the node's pcb using male header pins for a permanent, rigid  and low height card
* Connect to the node's pcb using male-female pin header combination, for a more flexible solution

How to use this repository
