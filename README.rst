Key features:
-------------
* Powered by 2xAA (1.5v) batteries or a single (3.0v) battery.
* Waterproof if installed in an "easy to find worldwide" 83x58x33mm waterproof plastic enclosure (multiple choices: clear cover, wall mounting tabs, etc.).
* Class A battery powered or Class C external powered via screw terminal.
* RAK4200 = SX1276+STM32L071. So no additional cpu/microcontroller needed for a complete solution.
* Can be programmed using `RAK Unified Interface (RUI) API, <https://doc.rakwireless.com/quick-start/rak5010-wistrio-nb-iot-tracker/rui-online-compiler>`_ for rapid development or STM32 CUBE LoRa stack.
* TH pad for a spring antenna or U.FL connector for external antenna.
* Prototyping/expansion area.
